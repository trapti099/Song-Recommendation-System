# Song Recommendation System

Welcome to our Song Recommendation System! My talented friend Shivam Mandhan and I have collaborated to create a music recommendation tool powered by machine learning, specifically content-based filtering.

With this nifty program, you can easily find new songs that match your preferences. Just input the name of a song you like, and voila! It'll generate a neat 10x5 table with similar songs, complete with artist details, album names, and even Spotify links!

## How It Works

üîç **Data Collection:** We've gathered an extensive music collection using the Spotify API and an external dataset from Kaggle.

üíæ **Data Storage:** We've stored all this valuable data securely in Google BigQuery, which allows for efficient data access and management.

üìä **Data Processing and Analysis:** Our secret sauce involves using powerful tools like Pandas and NumPy in Python to process and analyze the collected data.

‚öôÔ∏è **Data Usage:** By training a machine learning model, we've harnessed this processed data to provide you with personalized song suggestions.

## Why It's Awesome

Thanks to the magic of cloud technology, you can run this program seamlessly on any machine without the hassle of importing external datasets. It's perfect for music lovers looking to discover new tunes! If you're eager to give it a spin, feel free to reach out. We'd love to share the music discovery joy with you!

# Song-Recommendation-System
The Song Recommendation System project leverages data from the Spotify API to provide personalized song recommendations based on audio features. It utilizes a comprehensive database containing 2700 songs, each accompanied by their corresponding audio features. The data is processed and analyzed using Python, and the results are loaded into BigQuery for further exploration and modeling.
